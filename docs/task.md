# Practice Projects

## Day 1

Spend some time refining your idea and planning. Send me, around early-mid afternoon:

* Your fleshed out idea
* Your goals for the week (e.g. by end of Tuesday we expect to...)

## Tues-Thurs

In the evening, send me:

* Your updated plan and progress (e.g. today we got our MVP done, our updated goals are by end of Thurs we expect to...)
* A brief code review of your project (e.g. our testing coverage is high, we have to refactor this area tomorrow...)

In return, I'll send you

* A summarised code review of your project codebase

## Friday

* 4pm — Practice Projects Presentations. [Guidance here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/practice_project_week/presentation_guidelines.md)
* 5pm — Retro
